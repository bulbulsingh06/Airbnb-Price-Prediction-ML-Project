# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-ML-Project

## project Overview
This project predicts Airbnb listing prices based on property and host features.  
It includes full preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), evaluation, and feature interpretation.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess Airbnb listing data  
- Explore correlations and key price drivers  
- Train and compare multiple regression models  
- Visualize feature importance and model performance  

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Model Development & Evaluation**  
4. **Model Interpretation & Insights**  

## Results
- XGBoost achieved the best performance (lowest RMSE and highest R²).  
- Key factors influencing price: `accommodates`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `amenities`, `city`.  

## Key Insights
- Larger listings and premium locations command higher prices.  
- Feature importance helps hosts identify price-driving attributes.
